# Welcome to GreenBridge

We are a community building bio-diversity and food gardens to improve the ecologies in which we live.

## What we're doing

### Rooftop bio-diversity

This is a project (originally called rooftopbox) to create modular rooftop gardens using indigenous fynbos vegetation to build biodiversity using Cape Town's (many) flat rooftops.

Our first significant project has started at [Philippi Village](http://www.philippivillage.co.za/) where we have gotten the green-light to extend our pilot container-top garden to the whole container walk (x40).

### Greenpoint Neighbourhood Bridges

A first experiment, with a loosely-collaborating group of planters, having:
 - turned communal lawns into food-gardens, with perma-culture beds and community food-scrap collection
 - an indie garden around a power substation
 - verge planting projects in planning to change planting of these areas to indigineous
 - approval to use a memorial park that is currently barren to build a planted "bridge" from the Neighbourhood connecting to the neigbouring Table Mountain national park
 
### Monitoring growth from space

We are prototyping the use of [FarmPin](https://land.farmpin.com) plant growth graphs, originally designed for commerical farmers, to track changes in the vegetation index as we green neighbourhoods.
